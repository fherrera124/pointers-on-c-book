    <p class="zw">The elements of an array are stored in contiguous locations in memory. When an array
      is declared, its memory is allocated at compile time. However, you can also allocate
      the memory at runtime with dynamic memory allocation. In this chapter, we will
      examine the differences between these techniques and see when and how to use
      dynamic memory allocation.</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_230" class="calibre24">11.1 Why Use Dynamic Allocation</h2>

    <p class="zw">When declaring arrays, the array size must be given as a compile-time constant. Often,
      the actual size needed for the array is not known until run time because the amount of
      space depends upon the input data. For example, a program that computes student
      grades and averages might need to store data for all of the students in a class, but
      different classes will have different numbers of students. In these situations, the usual
      approach is to declare an array that is as big as it ever will need to be.</p>

    <p class="editing-tag">TIP</p>

    <blockquote class="ti_shi">
      <p class="zw"><br class="calibre1"></p>

      <p class="calibre2">This approach has the advantage of being simple, but it has several disadvantages.
        First, such declarations build an artificial limitation into the program, making it
        incapable of handling problems larger than the size used in the declaration. The
        obvious solution is to make the array even bigger, but the second problem then
        becomes even worse. Nearly all of the memory used for a huge array is wasted when
        the number of elements actually required is small. A third disadvantage is that the
        program must respond in a reasonable way when there is more input than the array
        can hold. It should not fail with an exception, and it must not print answers that look
        valid but in fact are wrong. The required logic is simple enough, but the assumption
        that "the array will never overflow" makes it very tempting to not bother
        implementing it.</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_231" class="calibre24">11.2 Malloc and Free</h2>

    <p class="zw">The C library provides two functions, malloc and free, that perform dynamic memory
      allocation and deallocation. These functions maintain a pool of available memory.
      When a program needs additional memory, it calls malloc, which takes an appropriate
      piece of memory from the pool and returns a pointer to this block of memory to the
      program. The memory is not initialized in any way. If it is important that the memory
      be initialized, you must either do it yourself or use the calloc function (described in
      the next section). When a previously allocated piece of memory is no longer needed,
      free is called to return it to the pool for later reuse.</p>

    <p class="zw">The prototypes for these two functions are shown below, and are in stdlib.h.</p>
    <pre class="code"><code class="calibre8">void　　*malloc( size_t size );
void　　free( void *pointer );</code></pre>

    <p class="zw">The argument to malloc is the number of bytes (characters) of memory that are
      needed <a id="ac111" href="#anchor111" class="calibre5"><sup class="calibre15">[1]</sup></a> . If the desired
      amount of memory is available, malloc returns a pointer to the
      beginning of the allocated block.</p>

    <p class="zw"> malloc allocates contiguous blocks of memory. For example, a request for 100
      bytes will be satisfied with 100 adjacent bytes, never with two or more separate
      chunks of memory. Also, malloc may actually allocate a chunk of memory slightly
      larger than requested. However, this behavior is implementation dependent, so you
      should not count on getting more memory than you requested.</p>

    <p class="zw">What if the pool of memory is empty, or it does not contain a big enough block?
      In this case, malloc calls the operating system to obtain more memory and begins
      allocating pieces from this new chunk. If the operating system is unable to give more
      memory to malloc, then a NULL pointer is returned. Thus it is vital that the pointer
      returned by every call to malloc be checked to ensure that it is not NULL.</p>

    <p class="zw">The argument to free must either be NULL or a value that was previously
      returned from malloc, calloc, or realloc (described below). Passing a NULL
      argument to free has no effect.</p>

    <p class="zw">How does malloc know whether you want to store integers, floating-point
      values, structures, or arrays in the memory you've requested? It doesn't—malloc
      returns a pointer of type void * for precisely this reason. The Standard states that a
      void * pointer can be converted to any other pointer type. Some compiler though,
      especially older ones, may require you to use a cast for the conversion.</p>

    <p class="zw">On machines with boundary alignment requirements, the memory returned by
      malloc will always begin on a boundary that is suitable for the data type with the most
      stringent alignment requirements.</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_232" class="calibre24">11.3 Calloc and Realloc</h2>

    <p class="zw">There are two additional memory allocation functions, calloc and realloc. Their
      prototypes are shown below.</p>
    <pre class="code"><code class="calibre8">void　　*calloc( size_t num_elements,
　　　　　　　　　 size_t element_size );
void　　realloc( void *ptr, size_t new_size );</code></pre>

    <p class="zw">calloc also allocates memory. The major difference between malloc and calloc is that
      the latter initializes the memory to zero before returning a pointer to it. This
      initialization is often convenient, but is a waste of time if the first thing your program
      does is to store values into the array. A minor difference between calloc and malloc is
      the way the amount of memory is requested, calloc takes the number of elements
      desired and the number of bytes in each element. From these values it computes the
      total number of bytes needed.</p>

    <p class="zw">The realloc function is used to change the size of a previously allocated block
      of memory. You can make a block larger or smaller with this function If a block is
      made larger, its old contents remain unchanged and additional memory is added to
      the end of the block. The new memory is not initialized in any way. If the block is
      made smaller, then memory is taken off of the end. What remains of the original
      contents are unchanged.</p>

    <p class="zw">If the original block cannot be resized, realloc will allocate a different block of the
      right size and copy the contents of the old block to the new one. Thus, you must not
      use the old pointer to the block after a call to realloc. Use the new pointer that is
      returned instead.</p>

    <p class="zw">Finally, if the first argument to realloc is NULL, then it behaves exactly like
      malloc.</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_233" class="calibre24">11.4 Using Dynamically Allocated Memory</h2>

    <p class="zw">Here is an example that obtains a chunk of memory from malloc.</p>

    <p class="calibre13"><img alt="" src="../images/00236.gif" class="calibre14"></p>

    <p class="zw">The symbol NULL is defined in stdio.h as the literal constant zero. It acts as a visual
      reminder that the value being tested is a pointer type rather than an integer.</p>

    <p class="zw">If there was memory available, we will now have a pointer to 100 bytes. On a
      machine with 4-byte integers, the memory will be treated as an array of 25 integers
      because pi is a pointer to an integer.</p>

    <p class="editing-tag">TIP</p>

    <blockquote class="ti_shi">
      <p class="zw"><br class="calibre1"></p>

      <p class="calibre2">If your goal is to get enough memory for 25 integers, though, here is a much better
        technique for obtaining it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <pre class="code"><code class="calibre8">pi = malloc( 25 * sizeof( int ) );</code></pre>

    <p class="zw">This approach is better because it is portable. It works properly even on machines with
      different size integers.</p>

    <p class="zw">Now that you have a pointer, how do you use the memory? Of course you can
      use indirection and pointer arithmetic to access different integer locations in this array,
      as in this loop, which sets each element of the newly allocated array to zero:</p>

    <p class="calibre13"><img alt="" src="../images/00237.gif" class="calibre14"></p>

    <p class="zw">As you have seen, you can use a subscript on the pointer as well. This second loop
      performs the same work as the previous one.</p>

    <p class="calibre13"><img alt="" src="../images/00238.gif" class="calibre14"></p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_234" class="calibre24">11.5 Common Dynamic Memory Errors</h2>

    <p class="zw">There are many errors that can occur in programs that use dynamic memory
      allocation. These include dereferencing NULL pointers, going outside the bounds of
      the memory that was allocated, freeing memory blocks that were not dynamically
      allocated, attempting to free a portion of a dynamic block, and continuing to use
      dynamic memory after it has been freed.</p>

    <p class="editing-tag">CAUTION!</p>

    <blockquote class="ti_shi">
      <p class="zw"><br class="calibre1"></p>

      <p class="calibre2">The most common error with dynamic memory allocation is forgetting to check
        whether the requested memory was allocated. Program 11.1 presents a technique that
        makes this error checking almost foolproof. The MALLOC macro takes the number of
        elements and type of each element, computes the total number of bytes needed, and
        calls alloc to obtain the memory <a id="ac112" href="#anchor112" class="calibre5"><sup
            class="calibre23">[2]</sup></a> . alloc calls malloc and then checks to make sure
        that the pointer returned was not NULL.</p>

      <p class="calibre2">The final piece of this puzzle is the very first #define. It prevents accidental
        calls directly to malloc by substituting junk into the program. If an accidental call is
        made, the program will not compile due to syntax errors. The #undef is needed in
        alloc so that it can call malloc without error.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="zw"><br class="calibre1"></p>

    <p class="editing-tag">CAUTION!</p>

    <blockquote class="ti_shi">
      <p class="zw"><br class="calibre1"></p>

      <p class="calibre2">The second biggest source of error with dynamically allocated memory is going
        outside of the bounds of the memory that was allocated. For example, if you have
        obtained an array of 25 integers, accessing elements with subscripts less than zero or
        greater than 24 can cause two types of problems.</p>

      <p class="calibre2">The first problem is obvious; the memory being accessed might be holding
        some other variable. Changing it here will destroy the variable, and changing the
        variable will destroy any value you store here. These kinds of bugs are very difficult to
        track down.</p>

      <p class="calibre2">The second problem is not so obvious. Some implementations of malloc and
        free keep the pool of available storage as a linked list. Modifying location outside the bounds of allocated
        memory can corrupt this list, which can cause exceptions that
        terminate the program.</p>

      blame the problems on malloc and free. They are rarely the culprit, though. In
      practice, the problem is nearly always in your program and is frequently caused by
      accessing data outside of the allocated memory.</p>

      <p class="calibre2">Different errors can occur when using free. The pointer passed to free must be a
        pointer that was obtained from malloc, calloc, or realloc. Calling free with a pointer
        to memory that was not dynamically allocated can cause the program to terminate
        either right away or at some later time. Similar problems can be caused by attempting
        to free only a portion of a dynamically allocated block, like this:</p>

      <p class="calibre2">Finally, you must be careful not to access memory that has been free'd. This warning
        may seem obvious, but there is a subtle problem here after all. Suppose copies are
        made of the pointer to a dynamically allocated block, and these copies are sent off to
        many different parts of the program. It is difficult to make sure that none of these
        other areas in the program use their copies of the pointer after the memory has been
        freed. Conversely, you must be sure that all parts of the program are finished using a
        chunk of memory before freeing it.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="zw"><strong class="calibre3">11.5.1 Memory Leaks</strong></p>

    <p class="zw">Dynamically allocated memory should be freed when it is no longer needed so that it
      can be reused later for other purposes. Allocating memory but not freeing it later
      causes a memory leak. With operating systems that share a common pool of memory
      among all executing programs, memory leaks dribble away the available memory so
      that eventually there isn't any left. Rebooting the computer is the only recovery for this
      situation.</p>

    <p class="zw">Other operating systems keep track of which pieces of memory each program
      currently has, so that when a program terminates all of the memory that it had
      allocated but had not freed is returned to the pool. Memory leaks are a serious
      problem even on these systems, because a program that continually allocates memory
      without ever freeing any will eventually exhaust the available memory. At this point,
      the defective program will not be able to continue executing, and its failure may result
      in the loss of the work completed so far.</p>

    <p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre3">Program 11.2 Sort a list of integers</strong></p>

    <p class="calibre11">sort.c</p>

    <p class="zw">Memory to hold the list is dynamically allocated so that when you are writing
      the program you don't have to guess how many values the user might wish to sort.
      The only limit on the number of values that can be sorted is the amount of dynamic
      memory available to the program. When small lists are sorted, though, only as much
      memory as is actually needed is allocated, so memory is not wasted.</p>

    <p class="zw">Now consider a program that reads strings. If you don't know the length of the
      longest string in advance you cannot use an ordinary array as a buffer. Instead, use
      dynamically allocated memory. When you find an input line that doesn't fit, reallocate
      a larger buffer and read the remainder of the line into it. The implementation of this
      technique is left as a programming exercise.</p>

    <p class="zw">The input is read into this buffer, one line at a time. The length of the string is
      determined, and then memory is allocated to hold it. Finally, the string is copied into
      the new memory so the buffer can be used to read the next line.</p>

    <p class="zw">The function in Program 11.3, called strdup, returns a copy of its input string in

      hold the copy. The additional byte beyond the string length is needed to hold the NUL
      byte that terminates the string. If the memory was successfully allocated, the string is
      copied into the new memory. Finally, a pointer to the new memory is returned.
      Notice that new_string will be NULL if the allocation failed for some reason, so a
      NULL pointer would be returned in this case.</p>

    <p class="zw">This function is very handy. It is so useful, in fact, that many environments
      include it as part of the library even though the Standard does not mention it.</p>

    <p class="zw">Our final example illustrates how you can use dynamic memory allocation to
      eliminate wasted memory with variant records. Program 11.4 is a modification of the
      inventory system example from Chapter 10. Program 11.4a contains the declarations
      for the inventory records.</p>

    <p class="zw">As before, the inventory system must handle two types of records, those for
      parts and those for subassemblies. The first structure holds the information specific to
      a part (only a portion of this structure is shown), and the second holds information
      about subassemblies. The last declaration is for the inventory record. It contains some
      common data needed for both subassemblies and parts and a variant portion.</p>

    <p class="zw">Because the different fields in the variant part are different sizes (in fact, the
      subassembly record is variable size), the union contains pointers to structures rather
      than the structures. Dynamic allocation lets the program create an inventory record
      that is the correct size for the item being stored, so there is no wasted memory.</p>

    <p class="zw">Program 11.4b is a function that creates an inventory record for a subassembly.
      This task depends on the number of different parts the subassembly contains, so this
      value is passed as an argument.</p>

    <p class="zw">This function allocates three things: the inventory record, the subassembly
      structure, and the array of parts in the subassembly structure. If any of these
      allocations fails, any memory that was already obtained is freed and a NULL pointer is
      returned. Otherwise, the type and info.subassy-&gt;n_parts fields are initialized and a
      pointer to the record is returned.</p>

    <p class="zw">Obtaining memory for an inventory record to store a part is a little easier than
      for a subassembly because only two allocations are needed. This function is therefore
      not illustrated here.</p>

    <p class="calibre11">invcreat.c</p>

    <p class="zw">Program 11.4c contains the last part of this example: a function that destroys
      inventory records. This function works for either type of inventory record. It uses a
      switch statement to determine the type of record it was given and then frees all
      dynamically allocated fields in the record. Finally, the record is deleted.</p>

    <p class="zw">A common mistake made in situations like this one is to free the record before
      freeing the memory pointed to by fields in the record. After the record has been freed,
      you may no longer safely access any of the fields that it contains.</p>

    <p class="calibre11">invdelet.c</p>

    <p class="zw">Although it is a little less obvious, the following code fragment is a slightly
      more efficient implementation of Program 11.4c.</p>

    <p class="calibre13"><img alt="" src="../images/00240.gif" class="calibre14"></p>

    <p class="zw">This code does not distinguish between subassemblies and parts when freeing the
      variant part of the record. Either member of the union can be used, as free does not
      care which type of pointer it gets.</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_236" class="calibre24">11.7 Summary</h2>

    <p class="zw">When an array is declared, its size must be known at compile time. Dynamic allocation
      allows a program to create space for an array whose size isn't known until runtime.</p>

    <p class="zw">The malloc and calloc functions both allocate memory and return a pointer to
      it. The argument to malloc is the number of bytes of memory needed. In contrast,
      calloc requires the number of elements you want and the size of each element. calloc
      initializes the memory to zero before returning, whereas malloc leaves the memory
      uninitialized. The realloc function is called to change the size of an existing block of
      dynamically allocated memory. Increases in size may be accomplished by copying the
      data from the existing block to a new, larger block. When a dynamically allocated
      block is no longer needed, free is called to return it to the pool of available memory.
      Memory must not be accessed after it has been freed.</p>

    <p class="zw">The pointer returned by malloc, calloc, and realloc will be NULL if the
      requested allocation could not be performed. Erroneously accessing memory outside
      of an allocated block may cause the same errors as accessing memory outside of an
      array, but can also corrupt the pool of available memory and lead to a program failure.
      You may not pass a pointer to free that was not obtained from an earlier call to malloc,
      calloc, or realloc. Nor may you free a portion of a block.</p>

    <p class="zw">A memory leak is memory that has been dynamically allocated but has not
      been freed and is no longer in use. Memory leaks increase the size of the program,
      and may lead to a crash of the program or the system.</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_237" class="calibre24">11.8 Summary of Cautions</h2>

    <p class="zw">1. Not checking the pointer returned from malloc for NULL (page 307).</p>

    <p class="zw">2. Accessing outside the bounds of dynamically allocated memory (page 307).</p>

    <p class="zw">3. Passing a pointer to free that did not originally come from malloc (page 309).</p>

    <p class="zw">4. Accessing dynamic memory after it has been freed (page 309).</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_238" class="calibre24">11.9 Summary of Programming Tips</h2>

    <p class="zw">1. Dynamic allocation helps eliminate built-in limitations in the program (page 303).</p>

    <p class="zw">2. Using sizeof to compute the size of data types enhances portability (page 306).</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_239" class="calibre24">11.10 Questions</h2>

    <p class="zw">1. What is the largest static array that you can declare on your system? The largest
      dynamically allocated piece of memory?</p>

    <p class="zw">2. What is the total amount of memory that you can dynamically allocate on your
      system when you ask for it 500 bytes at a time? When you ask for it 5000 bytes at a
      time? Is there a difference? If so, how do you explain it?</p>

    <p class="zw hand">3. In a program that reads strings from a
      file, is there any value that can logically be
      used for the size of the input buffer?</p>

    <p class="zw hand">4. Some C implementations provide a function
      called alloca, which differs from
      malloc in that it allocates memory on the stack. What are the advantages and
      disadvantages of this type of allocation?</p>

    <p class="zw hand">5. The following program, which is supposed
      to read integers in the range one
      through size from the standard input and return counts of how many times each
      value occurs, contains several errors. What are they?</p>
    <pre class="code"><code class="calibre8">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

　　 /*
　　 ** Adjust the pointer back one integer so we

    <p class="zw">6. Suppose you are writing a program and wish to minimize the amount of stack 
      space it uses. Will allocating arrays dynamically help? How about scalars?</p>

    <p class="zw">7. What would be the effect of deleting the two calls to free in Program 11.4b?</p>

    <h2 id="nav_point_240" class="calibre24">11.11 Programming Exercises</h2>

    <p class="zw">★ 1. Write your own version of the calloc function, using malloc to obtain memory.</p>

    <p class="zw hand">★★ 2. Write a function that reads a list of integers from the standard input and returns 
      the values in a dynamically allocated array. The end of the input list is determined 
      by watching for EOF. The first number in the array should be a count of how many 
      values the array contains. This number is followed by the values.</p>

    <p class="zw">★★★ 3. Write a function that reads a string from the standard input and returns a copy of 
      the string in dynamically allocated memory. The function may not impose any 
      limit on the size of the string being read!</p>

    <p class="zw">★★★ 4. Write a program to create the data structure in the following diagram. The last 
      three objects are structures which are dynamically allocated. The first object, which 
      may be static, is a pointer to a structure. You do not need to make this program 
      general—we will discuss this data structure in the next chapter.</p>
