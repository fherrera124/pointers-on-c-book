<h2 align="center"><i>Some Notes On the Character Classification Macros</i></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The character classification macros (defined in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ctype.h</font>) 
  provide a portable mechanism for determining whether a character is alphabetic, 
  numeric, punctuation, white space, etc. It is portable in that it does not require 
  the use of specific character constants for comaprison, which would be valid 
  on other machines only if they used the same character set. Consider this simple 
  example:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">if( ch &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 
  'Z' ) ...</font></p>
<p>The intent is to determine whether the character contained in the variable 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ch</font> is an upper-case alphabetic 
  character. This test works fine on computers whose character set is ASCII or 
  Extended ASCII ¹, but fails on compters that use the EBCDIC character set 
  (which, admittedly, are far less common these days than they were many years 
  ago). Conversely, the test:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">if( isupper( ch ) ) ...</font></p>
<p>will work regardless of the character set used by a particular machine because 
  the macro is implemented on each machine to work properly with its character 
  set.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>These macros are often implemented with a table-lookup mechanism. A table is 
  created that contains an entry for every character value, and each entry contains 
  flags to indicate whether the corresponding character is numeric, alphabetic, 
  upper case, lower case, etc. This table is automatically linked with the program 
  when the macros are used. The macro merely uses its argument as a subscript 
  to access an entry from this table and tests whether that entry contains the 
  flag for the desired characteristic.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>I will describe the problem in the context of computers with 8-bit bytes, as 
  they are the most common these days. This table-lookup scheme generally worked 
  fine in the days of ASCII when the values assigned to characters did not exceed 
  127. If the high-order bit of the byte was used at all, it was often used as 
  a parity bit for the detection of errors when characters were transmitted over 
  communications lines that were not as reliable as today's. Once the characters 
  were received and checked for errors, the parity bit was replaced with a 0.</p>
<p>The problem began with the expansion of the character set to include numerous 
  additional characters, for example currency symbols (such as ¢, £, 
  ¥), punctuation (such as ¡ and ¿), special characters (such 
  as ©, ±, and ½), and--most notably--characters that exist 
  in many languages but not in English (such as à, á, æ, etc.). 
  To represent all these additional characters without omitting any of the standard 
  ASCII characters, the values from 128 through 255 are used and the resulting 
  character set is commonly referred to as Extended ASCII ².</p>
<p>Now consider three traditional aspects of the C language:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Characters are promoted to integers before being used for any type of arithmetic.</li>
  <li>The default character type, either signed or unsigned, is not specified 
    by the Standard so that the implementer can choose whichever is most efficient 
    for a particular machine.</li>
  <li>There is no range checking on array subscripts.</li>
</ol>
<p>The combination of these three characteristics make it risky to use the character 
  classification macros with Extended ASCII characters. Consider the expression 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">isupper(ch)</font> where the variable 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ch</font> contains the value <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">0xc2</font> 
  (which is the character Â):</p>
<ol>
  <li>The macro evaluates to an expression something like this: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">( 
    _chartypes[ ch ] &amp; _CTYPE_UPPER )</font></li>
  <li>Because it is used in an expression, the value <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ch</font> 
    is first promoted to an integer. </li>
  <li>On a 32-bit machine whose default character type is signed, the result of 
    this promotion will be <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">0xffffffc2</font>, 
    or -62, due to sign extension.</li>
  <li>The machine now accesses <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">_chartypes[ 
    -62 ]</font> to see if it contains the bit <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CTYPE_UPPER.</font></li>
  <li>Because there is no range checking on subscripts, the access is attempted.</li>
  <li>If you are extremely lucky, the access is to a memory location outside of 
    the bounds of the program, and the program stops with an error.</li>
  <li>However, it is much more likely that the access will succeed and produce 
    an indeterminate result.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the implementer will have constructed a classification table containing 
  the proper flags in each of its 256 entries for each of the 256 Extended ASCII 
  characters. However, the test fails because the memory location that is checked 
  lies outside of this table.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>The solution is simple, though tedious. All arguments to the character classification 
  macros should be cast as unsigned integers. Because they are going to be promoted 
  to integers anyway, there is no point in casting the arguments to unsigned charcters, 
  though it does no harm to do so. The drawback of casting is the tedium of doing 
  it every time and the ease of forgetting to do it.</p>
<p>A better solution is to define your own set of macros to use instead of the 
  character classification macros, as in this example:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">#define safe_isupper(ch) isupper((unsigned 
  int)ch)</font></p>
<p>This solution is also not perfect, as it is easy to forget and use the standard 
  macros by mistake. Nor is it possible to undefine the standard macros to prevent 
  their accidental use because they are needed to expand the newly defined macros.</p>
<p>As is often the case in C, discipline (and a good memory) are needed to reliably 
  avoid the problem.</p>
<h3>Postscript</h3>
<p>I would love for this discussion to find its way into Pointers on C, but that 
  will never happen as the publisher has no interest in bringing out an updated 
  edition.</p>
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p>¹ One could argue that this test would fail for Extended ASCII character 
  sets in that it would not classify characters such as À, Ç, Ê 
  and Í as "upper case alphabetic."</p>
<p>² "Extended ASCII" is actually a misnomer, for it implies that 
  the ASCII definition itself was extended. In fact, this is not true (ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ascii).</p>
