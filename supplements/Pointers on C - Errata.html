<hr>The errors below have not yet been corrected, and the publisher is unlikely to ever correct them. I've organized this list
by the date each error was reported to me; this makes it easier to see what
has been added since the last time you checked the list.
<ul>
<li>

<li>
3/21/98 Page 199: 4 lines up from the bottom: the accent on "voila" is
backwards.</li>

<li>
3/21/98 Page 217, third paragraph from the bottom: The second sentence
should read, "Does matrix have six rows of ten columns each, or ten rows
of six columns each?"</li>

<li>
3/21/98 Page 610: Add an entry to the index: automatic 59, 213</li>

<li>
6/6/99 Page 575: The solution to programming problem 7-3 is incorrect.
The declaration for <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">digit</font>

should be added to the end of the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">while</font>
loop.</li>

<li>
2/2/00 Page 308: In program 11.1b, the string literal in the printf should
end with \n rather than \en.</li>
<li>
3/13/00 Page 263: In exercise 11, the comparison should be
case dependent, not case independent.</li>
<li>
6/17/00 Page 64, last line before section 3.10: Function d can indeed
call function i, but there will be no type checking on the arguments
due to the lack of a prototype.</li>
<li>
6/17/00 Page 169, 4 lines up from the bottom: omit the duplicate "the".</li>
<li>
6/17/00 Page 178, last line: change "lookup_entry" to "find_entry".</li>
<li>
6/17/00 Page 193, 3rd line: Remove the first occurrence of "it".</li>
<li>
6/17/00 Page 193, 2nd line from the bottom: "ellipsis" is spelled wrong.</li>
<li>
1/29/01 Page 198, 3rd paragraph (just before the example): In the sentence

"the first element in the array." to "the array (pointers to arrays are
discussed in section 8.2.2 and 8.2.3)."</li>
<li>
10/25/01 Page 42, line 16: Change "apostrophies" to "apostrophes".</li>

return" should be followed by: '\r'.</li>
<li>
3/7/02 Page 195, problem 1: The subscripts are broken in the line for

</li>
<li>
3/7/02 Page 196, problem 3: In the last sentence after the phrase
"multiply the value you have so far" add the words "by ten"
</li>
<li>
9/18/02 Page 212, second tip: After writing the tip,
I seem to have followed by own advice and removed the register declarations
from the function to let the compiler optimize it on its own.
I also eliminated the local variable.
The tip itself makes a valid point,
but the example doesn't illustrate it very well.
</li>
<li>
9/18/02 Pages 229 &amp; 230: the last block of the "register" string should contain
just a 0, not '0.
</li>
<li>
9/18/02 Page 576, problem 8-8: Starting with the second sentence,
the answer should read: "But a is actually where the array of integers begins, so the value obtained as the "pointer" will be the value of the first integer in the array."
</li>
<li>
10/1/02 Page 311, just before the 3rd <tt>exit( EXIT_FAILURE )</tt>: add
the line <tt>free( array );</tt> to fix the memory leak.
</li>
<li>
10/28/02 Page 466, section 16.4.1 and program 16.2: The Standard states
that setjmp can only be used as the entire controlling expression of an
iteration or selection statement
(optionally with a !, or a relational or equality operator and
an integral constant expression), or as the entire expression
in an expression statement.
In program 16.2, I separated the call to setjmp and the test of its result
in order to better explain each with its own comment.
However, assigning the value of setjmp to a variable violates this rule,
so the program should be:
<pre>switch( setjmp( restart ) ){
</pre>
</li>
<li>
10/28/02 Page 198 and 231: If x is an array name, the expression &amp;x
generates a pointer to the array, not a pointer to the first element.
While these values are numerically equal, they have different types.
</li>
<li>
4/22/03 Page 475: The prototype for the atexit function should be:
<pre>void atexit( void (*func)( void ) );
</pre>
</li>
<li>
4/22/03 Page 477: The prototype for the system function should be:
<pre>int system( char const *command );
</pre>
</li>
<li>
5/23/03 Page 294: The first line of code after the "else" should be:
<pre>y = rec.info.subassy.n_parts;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
5/23/03 Page 584: The answer to the 11th expression in problem 10.7
should be:
<pre>{ 18, nodes+2, nodes+1 }
</pre>
</li>
<li>
3/8/04 Page 43: The second line of the first example should be:
<pre>value = value - 060;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
9/22/06 Page 487: Two references to <tt>strxcoll</tt> should actually be <tt>strcoll</tt>.
</li>
<li>
7/30/07 Page 518: In the fifth paragraph, make the following changes:
<br>
<br>
... suppose an array of 200 elements is used ...
<br>
<br>
... they will be stored in locations 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, and 127, respectively.
<br>
<br>
... because the right child of 7 would be stored in location 255, ...
</li>
<li>
1/25/09 Page 111, halfway down the page, where it begins, Note that when the computer ...", change "evalutes" to "evaluates".
</li>
<li>
3/23/09 Instructor's Guide: The solution given for problem 11.1 is incorrect. Replace the <tt>while</tt> statement with this:<br>
<tt>for( ; n_elements &gt; 0; n_elements -= 1 )</tt>
</li>
<li>
3/30/09 Page 224, omit the duplicate "the" just before the list of assignments to <tt>matrix</tt>.
</li>
<li>
3/30/09 Instructor's Guide, Page 95, #10: should read "... to be changed if a copy of it were passed ..."
</li>
<li>
3/30/09 Page 464, about halfway down: should read "Format codes consist of a % character followed by a character that indicates the type of value desired."
</li>
<li>
3/30/09 Page 607, at the bottom of solution 17.6: The second call to "left_child" ought to be "right_child".
</li>
<li>
4/28/09 Instructor's Guide, page 7, #6 should read: "... because they all differ in the case ..."
</li>
<li>
4/28/09 Instructor's Guide, page 13: d(4) and e(4) should actually be d(6) and e(6).  Similarly, y(12) and y(19) should actually read y(13) and y(20).
</li>
<li>
4/28/09 Instructor's Guide, page 35: replace the first two lines of code with this:<br>
<tt>int n_primes = 1;<br>
int limit = 1000;</tt>
</li>
<li>
5/14/09 Instructor's Guide, page 58, 1st paragraph: The last sentence should read: "For this reason, this solution uses <tt>my_strlen</tt>, which is analagous to the <tt>my_strnlen</tt> function developed in exercise two.
</li>
</ul>
